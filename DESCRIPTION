The Remote Stall Motor Controller is designed to mount on a Circuitron(r) Tortoise slow motion switch machine and provides
bi-polar control with a single logic level line, such as provided by a cpNode, IOX16/32, SMINI, DOUT, or SPST toggle switch. 
The RSMC can also be used to control the MP1 switch motor.
